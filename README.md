# fileDownloader
 ## Client and Server apps that allow client to download files from server over TCP.

Built in the C language for the Computer Networks course @Facultatea de Informatica, UAIC, Iasi.

***How to use:***
 1. Run the server app
 2. Run the client app with this syntax: ```C ./client <ip_address> <port>```, but without the ```<>``` symbols. The IP address and port should be the ones of the server. (Currently the server has port 2040, and the IP of the local machine it's run on, or 0.0.0.0)
 3. Enter the name of the file that you want to download from the server's folder to the client's folder (or computer).
